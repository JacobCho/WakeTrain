Wake Train Android app
=======

An Android app that displays canoe and kayak races in British Columbia and Washington. It pulls JSON data from their respective public Google Calendars and puts them into an easy to read list. Having events in Google Calendars allows other users to edit them, as well as give users notifcations through Google Now.
